# Can of Books

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

**Authors**: Chris and Cam
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates

## Credit and Collaborations


### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

  - 2pm daily and stay in the same huddle to collaborate on the app.
  - 4pm break
  - 7-9pm possible late meetup if we struggle

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack as main, alternitives will be considereed by needs.

- How often will you take breaks?

Every couple hours or as needed.

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Utilize our late hours to make up any issues we fall short of solving during the day.

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

  - Cam
    - Strong understanding of code
    - Good at math
    - Willing to understand and grow
  - Chris
    - Strong coding experience
    - Driven to improve on aspects of design
    - Enjoys problem solving
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

With our combined skill sets the technology stack shouldn't be overwhelming allowing us to focus on refinement and a production worthy look.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

  - Cam
    - Stronger communication
    - Ingrained process of development
    - Better use of collaboration tools
  - Chris
    - Stronger communication
    - Better understanding of design
    - Partner debugging

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

We utilize slack huddles, and branch merges to talk and go over the code base. In accordance with our meeting schedule above.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

  - Address the workload imbalance.
  - Set clear expectations and divide tasks equally, defining specific tasks and timelines for each person to work on.
  - Hold each other accountable by setting up regular check-ins, progress reports, or milestones.
  - Seek outside help if necessary, such as a mentor, supervisor, or mediator.
  - Approach the situation with a collaborative mindset, aiming to find a solution that works for everyone involved.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

  - Address the issue through an open and honest conversation.
  - Set clear expectations for each person's roles and responsibilities.
  - Divide tasks equally.
  - Hold regular check-ins to review progress and discuss any issues.
  - Seek outside help, such as a mentor or mediator, if necessary.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

To build an application with someone who may have a different level of understanding and skill level, it's important to establish clear communication, openly discuss each other's strengths and weaknesses, and agree on a plan to work together effectively. This can involve setting specific goals, timelines, and dividing up tasks based on each other's skill level. Patience and empathy are also key aspects to consider, as it's natural for people to have different levels of experience and understanding. Regular communication and documentation of progress can help ensure that everyone is on the same page throughout the project. Additionally, remaining open to feedback and willing to learn from each other can help leverage each other's strengths and ultimately achieve shared goals.
